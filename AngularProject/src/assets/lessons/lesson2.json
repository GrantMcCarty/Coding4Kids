        "Now that you have learned about what coding is…now we will start learning some basic Java concepts. We know that computers allow us to interact with computers, for example if we play a game, almost everything you see in that game is a variable. For example, each game character and game component is represented by a variable and is stored and used within the games code. Variables are used in games because game characters and the game environment is constantly changing based on your (the user) input. Without variables, there would be no variation in the game, and it would be really boring. When coding, variables are used to store values that are important to the game, program, or application that you may be coding.", 
        "To illustrate exactly what a variable does, picture we have an empty box. (Draw box) And this box can be filled with a variety of things. Let’s fill this box with green balls. Here the box represents a variable, and the balls represent the values that we can store in a variable. Now let’s add a few more boxes, and fill them with purple and red balls. These balls also represent values that can be stored in variables (the boxes). The different colors that can be stored in these boxes represent the different types of variables that exist. In certain boxes, only green balls can be stored, while in other boxes only purple boxes can be stored. Each variable (box) can only store a certain kind of color, just as each variable can store a certain type of value. There are 5 variables that we use in Java that we will discuss in this lesson. Strings, Boolean, int, double, and char. Each of these variables represent a box, but only a certain type of color ball can occupy each box.", 
        "Strings are variables that represent words and characters. If we wanted to have a variable store a sentence, we would label that variable a string and set it equal to the words or phrase. That may look something like this: String sentence = “Hello!”; ….But what if we only wanted to store a single letter, then we would use a char variable, and that would look something like this: Char character = “A”; Char variables only store a single (one) character or letter of the alphabet.",
        "If we wanted to store numbers we would use a variable called an integer to store a numeric value. int number = 100; If we wanted to store a decimal or fraction we would use a variable called a double. Both doubles, and integers store numbers, but doubles store numbers that are not whole numbers. Double = 5/2; or double = 10.5; Boolean variables store true or false. Boolean code = true;",
        "As you may have noticed, in order to code or write a value to a variable we need to first state the type of variable (Boolean, string, char, int, or double) and then write the name of the variable (must being with a lowercase), an equal sign, and then the value of the variable.",
        "Let’s practice: If we want to name a variable giraffe, and store the STRING “I am a giraffe” in that variable, what would that look like? Remember to write the type of variable, then the name, then write what that variable name is equal to…",
        "What if we wanted to name a variable five, and store the number 5 in that variable, what would that look like?",
